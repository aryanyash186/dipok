    <h3><b>Steve Jobs</b>, in full <b>Steven Paul Jobs</b>, (born February 24, 1955, <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/San-Francisco-California">San Francisco</a>, <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state">California</a>, U.S.—died
        October 5,
        2011, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Palo-Alto">Palo Alto</a>, California), cofounder of Apple
        Computer, Inc. (now <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apple-Inc">Apple Inc</a>.), and a <a
            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charismatic">charismatic</a> pioneer of
        the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer">personal computer</a> era.</h3>

    <h1 class="mkl"><span>Founding of Apple</span></h1>

    <h3>Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Silicon-Valley-region-California">Silicon Valley</a>.
        Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Reed-College">Reed College</a>, in
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Portland-Oregon">Portland</a>, <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Oregon-state">Oregon</a>, took a job at Atari Corporation
        as a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-game">video game</a> designer in early 1974, and saved
        enough money
        for a pilgrimage to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/India">India</a> to experience <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.
    </h3>

    <h3>Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Gary-Wozniak">Stephen Wozniak</a>, a former <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/high-school">high school</a>friend
        who was working for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hewlett-Packard-Company">Hewlett-Packard
        Company</a>. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own
        computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard
        formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Apple-I">Apple
        I</a>, as they called the logic board, was built in the
        Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable
        calculator.</h3>
